“Life breaks free. Life expands to new territories. Painfully, perhaps even dangerously. But life finds a way.”
― Dr. Ian Malcolm, Jurassic Park
The earth is now driven into a scene of battle and retreat as spaceships are loading civilians for transplant to other worlds.And life in this new world is quite harsh but no problem there are engineers who find a solution for everything. Perhaps thats the reason why yuMITians have thought of such a competition.We as competitors or as web developers, engineers ofcourse  have built various websites to help sustain life in this new world.
